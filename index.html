        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I have a huge passion for learning and helping others learn. I tend to take on challenging tasks because I love the feeling of getting through something particularly difficult and living to tell the tale.</p>
        <p>Although my original plans involved being more in the math/science field, my transition to the software development industry. I get the same challenging rush, but it also feels much more practical and it's and industry that never seems to stop growing.</p>
        <p>I appreciate you taking the time to explore. Please feel free to contact me at any time!

        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p>I majored in Physics with minors in both Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh, and graduated with a Bachelors of Science w/ Honors in April, 2012.</p>
        <p>My major curriculum consisted of 3 courses in Newtonian Mechanics, 3 courses in Electricity and Magnetism, 2 courses in Quantum Mechanics, 1 course in Statistical Mechanics/Thermodynamics, 2 courses in Modern Physics, 1 course in Computational Physics, and labs in Optics, Digital/Analog Electronics, and Modern Physics.</p>
        <p>The Math minor took me up through Calculus 1-3, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Complex Variable Analysis, Vector/Tensor Analysis, and Differential Geometry. The Computer Science minor required Intermediate Programming in Java, Introduction to Assembly Language/Digital Logic, and Data Structures.</p>
        <p>I graduated with 141 credits, and what I feel to be a very well-rounded skillset. I'm convinced I can learn anything, and I have yet to be proven wrong about that.</p>
