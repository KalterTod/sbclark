      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I have a huge passion for learning and helping others learn. I tend to take on challenging tasks because I love the feeling of getting through something particularly difficult and living to tell the tale.</p>
      <p>Although my original plans involved being more in the math/science field, I have recently begun a transition to the software development industry. I get the same challenging rush, but it also feels much more practical and it's and industry that never seems to stop growing.</p>
      <p>I appreciate you taking the time to explore. Please feel free to contact me at any time!</p>

      <h1>Education</h1>
      <p>My education consisted of a major in Physics with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I graduated in 2012 with departmental honors from the Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
      <p>I wanted to make myself as well rounded as possible, so I took a plethora of courses (both required and elective) in all three fields, and I also tutored Math from Algebra 1, through Calc 1-3, Differential Equations, and Lineary Algebra.</p>
      <p>I was also a member of the Society of Physics Students for my entire tenure at Pitt. We took trips to the Allegheny Observatory, and met frequently to discuss happenings in the world of Physics and our current courseload.</p>
      <p>My coursework was very intensive, requiring over 70 credits in Math and Physics, plus an additional 9 credits of Math and 12 credits of Computer Science for those respective minors.<p>
      <p>The University of Pittsburgh was an awesome place to learn, and if I had a chance to do it all over again, I would certainly stick with Pitt as my college of choice.</p>

      <h1>Current Job</h1>
      <p>I am currently working as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at Mobiquity, Inc (beginning in August, 2013). I have been exposed to several technologies while here, but my primary focuses have been mobile testing and API testing. Mobile testing is done with both manual and automated methods.</p>
      <p>Most commonly used automation tool is Appium, as it allows for simple cross-platform testing for iOS and Android. The most commonly used framework for automated API testing is Mocha, written in node.js</p>
      <p>Smaller projects consisted of team members in the 4-5 people range. Larger projects could have as many as 20 team members. The projects are almost exclusively operated in an Agile environment.</p>
